    <h2>Airborne LiDAR </h2>
    <p><p>Airborne lidar, also known as airborne laser scanning, involves the utilization of a laser scanner affixed to an 
        aircraft during its flight to generate a high-resolution 3-D point cloud representation 
        of the terrain. This approach currently stands as the most precise and meticulous technique for crafting digital elevation 
        models, supplanting the traditional method of photogrammetry.</p></p>

        <h2>Key Components:</h2>
        <ul>
            <div class="info">
      <p><b>LiDAR Technology:</b>
        LiDAR systems use lasers to measure distances by emitting rapid pulses of laser light and measuring the time it takes for the light to bounce back after hitting an object.
        These laser pulses are emitted from a LiDAR sensor mounted on an aircraft, such as an airplane or helicopter.
</p></div>
<div class="info">
    <p>
<b>Data Collection Process:</b>
During an airborne LiDAR survey, the aircraft flies over the area of interest in a systematic pattern, typically in a series of parallel flight lines.
The LiDAR sensor emits laser pulses towards the ground at a high rate, often thousands of pulses per second.
As the laser pulses hit the ground or other objects, they bounce back to the LiDAR sensor.
The sensor records the time it takes for each pulse to return and the angle at which it was emitted.
   </p> </div>
      <div class="info">
        <p>
<b>GPS and IMU Integration:</b>
To accurately georeference the LiDAR data, Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors are usually integrated into the airborne system.
GPS provides precise location information, while IMU records the aircraft's orientation and motion.
Combining GPS and IMU data with the LiDAR data allows for the creation of highly accurate 3D point clouds.
</p></div>
<div class="info"><p>
<b>Point Cloud Generation:</b>
The recorded time, angle, and GPS/IMU data are used to calculate the X, Y, and Z coordinates of each laser point.
These data points are collectively referred to as a "point cloud" and represent the 3D structure of the terrain, objects, and vegetation in the survey area.
</p></div>
<div class="info">
    <p>
<b>Data Processing:</b>
After data collection, post-processing steps are performed to filter out noise, correct for atmospheric conditions, and align the point cloud with the Earth's surface.
Sophisticated software tools are used to process and visualize the LiDAR data, allowing for the creation of digital elevation models (DEMs), digital surface models (DSMs), and other products.

    <h2>Drone Survey</h2>
    <p>
        Aerial surveying entails the gathering of geomatics and related imagery through the utilization of aircraft, 
        helicopters, UAVs, balloons, or similar aerial means. The information typically gathered encompasses aerial photography, Lidar, 
        remote sensing (harnessing diverse electromagnetic spectrum bands, both visible and invisible, such as infrared, gamma, or ultraviolet).

    <div class="info">
        <p>
            A drone survey, also known as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) survey or drone mapping, is a modern and efficient method of collecting geospatial data, images, and
            videos using remotely piloted drones or unmanned aerial vehicles. Drone surveys have gained popularity across various industries due to their versatility, cost-effectiveness, 
            and the ability to capture high-resolution data from vantage points that were previously difficult or expensive to access.
